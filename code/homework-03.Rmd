## Problem 1a. Data Summarizing (5 points)

To compare my response variable—**number of steps per day**—between different **days of the week**, I could calculate the **mean number of steps** for each day. This would allow me to identify patterns, such as whether I am more active on weekdays compared to weekends.

This comparison is informative because my schedule varies during the week. For example, I have back-to-back classes on Monday and Wednesday, which usually requires more walking, whereas I tend to stay home on Sundays, resulting in fewer steps.

# Load the data
```{r}
data <- read_csv(here("data", "personal_data.csv"))
```
